# Retail Store Sales and Profit Analysis with Python and Apriori Algorithm

This repository contains a **comprehensive sales and profit analysis project** based on the **Superstore dataset** (10,000+ rows of retail sales data).  
The project leverages Python libraries for **data processing, visualization, and association rule mining**, enabling insights into customer behavior, sales performance, and profit trends.

The project is based on the report:  
*Store Sales and Profit Analysis and Improvement*  
by Usama Habib and Ghaith Jamjoum.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology
The workflow is structured as follows:  

1. **Data Input**  
   - Load *Sample-Superstore.csv* into a Pandas DataFrame.  
   - Clean and preprocess data (date formatting, new columns for month/year/day).  

2. **Exploratory Analysis**  
   - Sales by month, profit by month  
   - Sales & profit by category and sub-category  
   - Segment-level sales/profit comparison  

3. **Improvements**  
   - User filtering by product and country  
   - Ratio analysis: profit-to-sales ratios for specific filters  

4. **Association Rule Mining**  
   - Use **Apriori** to uncover frequent item sets  
   - Generate **association rules** to understand customer purchase behavior  
   - Save results into CSV for further recommendation system design
